# Azure Developer Command Line Deploy

**Note:** This Logic App project is set up to be ready for an AZD deploy, but Logic Apps projects are not supported yet as a valid deploy target, so the AZD command will fail. Once Logic Apps are supported, this project will be updated to support an AZD deploy method.

See [Deploy using AZD Command Line Tool](/Docs/AzdDeploy.md)
