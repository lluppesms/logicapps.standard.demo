# Azure Developer Command Line Deploy

**Note:** This Logic App project is set up to be ready for an AZD deploy, but Logic Apps projects are not supported yet as a valid deploy target, so the AZD command will fail. Once Logic Apps are supported, this project will be updated to support an AZD deploy method.

When it is supported, move the infra files to the /infra folder, and the azure.yaml file to the root folder, and it should be ready to use azd.

See [Deploy using AZD Command Line Tool](/Docs/AzdDeploy.md)
